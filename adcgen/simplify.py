def remove_tensor(expr: e.Expr, t_name: str) -> dict:
    """
    Removes a tensor from each term of an expression by undoing the contraction
    of the remaining term with the tensor. The resulting expression is split
    according to the blocks of the removed tensor. Note that only canonical
    tensor blocks are considered, because the non-canonical blocks can be
    generated from the canonical ones, e.g., removing a symmetric matrix d_{pq}
    from an expression can only result in expressions for the 'oo', 'ov' and
    'vv' blocks, since d_{ai} = d_{ia}.
    The symmetry of the removed tensor is taken into account, such that the
    original expression can be restored if all block expressions are
    contracted with the corresponding tensor blocks again.
    Note that for ADC-Amplitudes a special prefactor is used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    expr : Expr
        The expression where the tensor should be removed.
    t_name : str
        Name of the tensor that should be removed.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        key: Tuple of removed tensor blocks
        value: Part of the original expression that contained the corresponding
               blocks. If contracted with the tensor blocks again, a part of
               the original expression is recovered.
