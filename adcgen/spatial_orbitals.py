    Transforms an expression to a spatial orbital basis by integrating over

    ----------
    expr : Expr
        Expression to express in terms of spatial orbitals.
    target_idx : str
        The names of target indices of the expression. Needs to be provided,
        because the target indices in the expression are stored in canonical
        order, which might not be correct.
    target_spin : str
        The spin of the target indices, e.g., 'aa' for 2 alpha orbitals.
    restricted : bool, optional
        Whether a restricted reference (equal alpha and beta orbitals)
        should be assumed. In case of a restricted reference, only alpha
        orbitals will be present in the returned expression.

        <pq||rs> = <pq|rs> - <pq|sr> = (pr|qs) - (ps|qr),
